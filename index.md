# Things to do before arriving
  1. Request unlock code from your carrier
    - If you haven't already, I recommend you request an unlock code from your provider so you can use international SIM cards, you can buy an unlimited 3G plan for cheap for your whole trip in Taipei if you need it. Otherwise, this isn't necessary.

# Things to do upon arriving
  1. EasyCard
    - These are used to ride the buses/MRT and sometimes can be used as a form of payment
    - They are available at any MRT station and possibly the airport you are arriving at. Just ask for 悠遊卡.

  2. Unlimited 3G
    - Can be purchased at any ChungHwa telecom.
    - Ask for 3G 吃到飽 (all you can eat).
    - This was extremely helpful for navigating, translating, looking things up.
    - It was about $33 for a month for me, I'm not sure what the pricing is for less than a week.

  3. Buy a towel and some cooler clothes
    - It's hot as fuck in Taiwan, I recommend buying a small towel for wiping down sweat and some breezier clothes.
    - You can get towels from any convenience store (there are a shitton)
      - 7-eleven, hi-life, FamilyMart, etc.
    - Uniqlo or MUJI for cute stuff and breezier clothes.

# Taipei Day Trips

## Maokong
This is a nice way to end the day in Taipei, it is a small city at the top of the mountain. You take a scenic 15-ish minute gondola ride and can enjoy sweeping views of Taipei from here. I recommend going before sunset and having dinner there at a restaurant named 阿義師. Sunset time is around 6PM-7PM.

After enjoying the view and sunset, you can ride down to Chih Nan Temple to explore the temple at night, the lanterns are pretty. Be wary of the Gondola operating hours. They differ based on the day of the week.

When you get to 阿義師, ask for a seat by the railing, you will get better views. The fried shrimp balls and the fish were pretty good. I forgot what they were called. Their special "Tea Fried Rice" was just okay and stained our teeth, making us look like ogres. Let me know if you want me to book this ahead of time for you.

    To get there:
      1. Take the MRT to Taipei Zoo
      2. Walk ~100m to the Maokong Gondola station.
      3. Use your EasyCard.

There are two types of gondolas: regular and glass-bottom. The wait for the glass-bottom is usually much longer. We decided to pass.

## Yangming Shan (Mt. Qixing)

The highest mountain peak in Taipei, and doable in a day. It's a hike that lasts about 1.5 hours, but it's totally worth it. You can see much of Taipei from the top of the mountain along with some...pools of sulfur? I'm not sure but it's cool. You are also walking in the clouds.

    To get there:
      1. Take the MRT to JianTan Station
      2. There are bus stops along the side of the station (I forgot which side)
      3. Take the R5 bus to the YangMingShan bus terminal (Should be the last station)
      4. Look for signs towards the Second Parking Lot. The visitor center should be near.
      5. Walk past the visitor center until you see a stone path. This is where the hiking trail begins.

When you're done with your hike, go to ZhuZiHu for sure! There's a sea of flowers and some places for you to relax. You can also pay a small price ($1-$3) to pick some pretty flowers to take home! There are also some fancy dango desserts that you should try out.

    To get there:
      1. Look for bus stops on YangMingShan with Little 8 (小八) or Little 9 (小九)
      2. Ask if it goes to ZhuZiHu

Be sure to leave the mountain before 6:30PM, the buses stop going to pick passengers up and you don't want to be stuck there. I think any bus down the mountain will do. I forget. You can always just ask ;P. Don't be afraid to ask for things in Taiwan! People are friendly and eager to help.

## JiuFen and PingXi

    To be added

## Sun Moon Lake

Taiwan's largest lake. It's a very pretty sapphire color and sunsets over the area are beautiful. You can ride your bike around the whole lake, too. I highly recommend the 小吃 in this area. They have some interesting ones like 雞翅包飯(Rice wrapped in Chicken Wing) and 掛包(Pork Buns). The handmade mochi from 陳記 is also amazing. We've tried most of the stalls, so let us know if you visit, we will send you which ones we think are best. The best eats are at ItaThao 伊達邵. We recommend ending your day there for dinner.

## TamShui (淡水)

    To be added

# Taipei Food and Desserts

## Din Tai Fung (鼎泰豐)

Of course this was going to be on the list. I recommend going to the one in SOGO at the Zhongxiao Fuxing MRT station as it has more space in the restaurant. You will wait between 30 minutes to an hour depending on the line. I recommend getting the 小籠包 and 蝦仁蛋炒飯. It's just fried rice but it's so good lol.

## Ice Monster (Shaved ice)

Taiwan's hot af so cool off at night with [Ice Monster](http://www.ice-monster.com/)! It's delicately shaved ice that's super fluffy and delicious. There's one in Taipei and it opens pretty late. I recommend getting the ice made with mango (Taiwan's mangos are the best). There are two types but I forgot which one is which but get the one that's more mango-ey (sorry that's all I got).

## SanHoYan

Cute Taiwanese Cuisine! See [here](https://sflow00.wordpress.com/2015/04/11/sanhoyan-%E5%8F%81%E5%92%8C%E9%99%A2-restaurant-in-taipei/). It has cute buns with faces on it.
  
    To get there:
      1. Take the MRT to ZhongXiao Fuxing station
      2. Take exit 4
      3. It's a short walk from exit 4 further away from the main roads (Google maps)

## Shilin Night Market

The most famous night market in Taiwan. You can get a variety of 小吃here. An easy strategy is to go where there are the most people.

    We recommend:
      - Fried Oyster Omelette
        - This is one of the classic Taiwanese dishes
        - Go down to the basement floor area of the night market
        - Look for the seating area with a bunch of flustered asian boys in red aprons (Should be crowded)
      - 車輪餅(cart wheel sandwich?)
        - It's like a waffle sandwich with cream and fruits
        - Will upload photos
      - Ice cream rolls (One of our favorites)
        - Ice cream rolled in rice paper(?) with almonds and cilantro 

    If you're adventurous: 
      - Stinky Tofu
      - Pig's Blood

    To get there:
      1. Take the MRT to JianTan station
      2. Take the exit towards Shilin Night market (it's right outside)
