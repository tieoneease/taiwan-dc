# Things to do before arriving
  1. Request unlock code from your carrier
    - If you haven't already, I recommend you request an unlock code from your provider so you can use international SIM cards, you can buy an unlimited 3G plan for cheap for your whole trip in Taipei if you need it. Otherwise, this isn't necessary.

# Things to do upon arriving
  1. EasyCard
    - These are used to ride the buses/MRT and sometimes can be used as a form of payment
    - They are available at any MRT station and possibly the airport you are arriving at. Just ask for 悠遊卡.

  2. Unlimited 3G
    - Can be purchased at any ChungHwa telecom.
    - Ask for 3G 吃到飽 (all you can eat).
    - This was extremely helpful for navigating, translating, looking things up.
    - It was about $33 for a month for me, I'm not sure what the pricing is for less than a week.

  3. Buy a towel and some cooler clothes
    - It's hot as fuck in Taiwan, I recommend buying a small towel for wiping down sweat and some breezier clothes.
    - You can get towels from any convenience store (there are a shitton)
      - 7-eleven, hi-life, FamilyMart, etc.
    - Uniqlo or MUJI for cute stuff and breezier clothes.

# Taipei Day Trips

## Maokong
This is a nice way to end the day in Taipei, it is a small city at the top of the mountain. You take a scenic 15-ish minute gondola ride and can enjoy sweeping views of Taipei from here. I recommend going before sunset and having dinner there at a restaurant named 阿義師. Sunset time is around 6PM-7PM.

After enjoying the view and sunset, you can ride down to Chih Nan Temple to explore the temple at night, the lanterns are pretty. Be wary of the Gondola operating hours. They differ based on the day of the week.

When you get to 阿義師, ask for a seat by the railing, you will get better views. The fried shrimp balls and the fish were pretty good. I forgot what they were called. Their special "Tea Fried Rice" was just okay and stained our teeth, making us look like ogres. Let me know if you want me to book this ahead of time for you.

    To get there:
      1. Take the MRT to Taipei Zoo
      2. Walk ~100m to the Maokong Gondola station.
      3. Use your EasyCard.

There are two types of gondolas: regular and glass-bottom. The wait for the glass-bottom is usually much longer. We decided to pass.

## Yangming Shan (Mt. Qixing)

The highest mountain peak in Taipei, and doable in a day. It's a hike that lasts about 1.5 hours, but it's totally worth it. You can see much of Taipei from the top of the mountain along with some...pools of sulfur? I'm not sure but it's cool. You are also walking in the clouds.

    To get there:
      1. Take the MRT to JianTan Station
      2. There are bus stops along the side of the station (I forgot which side)
      3. Take the R5 bus to the YangMingShan bus terminal (Should be the last station)
      4. Look for signs towards the Second Parking Lot. The visitor center should be near
      5. Walk past the visitor center until you see a stone path. This is where the hiking trail begins.

Be sure to leave the mountain before 6:30PM, the buses stop going to pick passengers up and you don't want to be stuck there. I think any bus down the mountain will do. I forget. You can always just ask ;P. Don't be afraid to ask for things in Taiwan! People are friendly and eager to help.

# Taipei Food and Desserts

## Din Tai Fung (鼎泰豐)

Of course this was going to be on the list. I recommend going to the one in SOGO at the Zhongxiao Fuxing MRT station as it has more space in the restaurant. You will wait between 30 minutes to an hour depending on the line. I recommend getting the 小籠包 and 蝦仁蛋炒飯. It's just fried rice but it's so good lol.

## Ice Monster (Shaved ice)

Taiwan's hot af so cool off at night with Ice Monster! It's delicately shaved ice that's super fluffy and delicious. There's one in Taipei and it opens pretty late. I recommend getting the ice made with mango (Taiwan's mangos are the best). There are two types but I forgot which one is which but get the one that's more mango-ey (sorry that's all I got).
